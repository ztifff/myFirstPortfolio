## About

This is my very first portfolio website. I created it to:

- Showcase my skills and projects  
- Provide a professional web presence  
- Practice building responsive web applications using modern front-end technologies  

Through this project, I’ve strengthened my understanding of React components, Bootstrap styling, and responsive design principles.

- **Projects Section** — highlights my favorite work (with links to live demos or GitHub)

## Future Improvements

---

 Here are some ideas I plan to implement as I grow:
  
- Add a blog section to share technical write-ups
- Improve SEO and accessibility
- Integrate a back-end contact form (e.g., via an API)
- Include animations or transitions for a more engaging UI
